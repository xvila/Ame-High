# Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa
Kaggle Link: [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

1. The goal of this project will be to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa
2. I will be using the Kaggle competition listed above. Kaggle provides a dataset for training the model and then testing it.
3. The data contains 79 explanatory variables describing aspects of residential
   homes in Ames, Iowa. In total there are 1460 observations. The data will need some cleansing since there are instances where text data has been added to numerical columns.
4. I chose this topic for a few reasons:
	1. This is a great intro to machine learning project to get amateurs comfortable working through Kaggle competitions.
	2. It is relevant to my current work which is in the real estate industry.
	3. Since it is provided by Kaggle I know all of the necessary data is there to make predictions.
